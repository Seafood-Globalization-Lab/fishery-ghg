Notes on STAN syntax: https://www.weirdfishes.blog/blog/fitting-bayesian-models-with-stan-and-r/

int N; integer object called N

vector[N] Y; 
// a vector of real numbers called Y of length N
// technically, STAN treats vectors as matrices so Y is a matrix of size [N,1]


// vector vs array have completely different syntax
// only vectors (not arrays) allow vector/matrix algebra 
int index[n]; array called 'index' of n, 1 dimensional objects, each storing integers 
// can use this to store indices showing which columns correspond to different subgroups

vector<lower = 0>[n] x; 
// vector with a lower bound of 0 of length n, called 'x'

vector<lower = 0, upper = 100>[n] x;

// specifying the model:
some_thing ~ some_distribution(distribution_parameters)
